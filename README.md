# EMPageViewController

## A better page view controller for iOS
EMPageViewController is a full replacement for UIPageViewController with the features and predictability youâ€™ve always wanted from a page view controller.

### Delegate messages every step of the way
EMPageViewController gives your delegate messages for every step of the page transition process: before, during, and after. This makes it very easy for you to incorporate animations or any other events that are highly dependent on the progress of transitioning a page.

### Convenient navigation functions
In addition to the ability scroll to any view controller, you can also easily scroll to the next or previous page without gestures if your app has navigation buttons.

### Written in Swift
EMPageViewController is not a subclass of UIPageViewController. Instead, it's a subclass of UIViewController with a UIScrollView, written in Swift, and it has common sense delegate and datasource functions that will make the development of your page-based iOS app a breeze.
